        <h3>
           What triggers the "Edits" to populate the menu on the right hand side of the application?
        </h3>

        <p>
           What triggers the edits depends on what type of edit it is. Words, and sentences, will be triggered by spaces, and periods, repsectively. 
            So everytime you enter a word and subsequently hit space, that word will be added into the "Words" section of the edit menu. 
            Likewise for sentences, when you end a sentence with a period, that will trigger that sentence to be pushed onto the "Sentences" section
            of the edit menu.
           
        </p>
    
      <h3>

        <p>
           Absolutely! Simply select those edits across the different sections you'd like to delete, and voila, they're deleted, or undone.
