                <p> What triggers the edits depends on what type of edit it is. Words, and sentences, will be triggered
                    by spaces, and periods, repsectively.
                    So everytime you enter a word and subsequently hit space, that word will be added into the "Words"
                    section of the edit menu.
                    Likewise for sentences, when you end a sentence with a period, that will trigger that sentence to be
                    pushed onto the "Sentences" section of the edit menu. </p>
